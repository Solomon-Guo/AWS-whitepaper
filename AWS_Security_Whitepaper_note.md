##Shared Security Responsibility Model
- AWS is responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure that supports the cloud
- you're responsible for anything you put on the cloud or connect to the cloud
- reduce your operaional burden in many ways, and in some cases may even improve your default security posture without additional action on your part

The amount of security configuration work you have to do varies depending on which services you select and how sensitive your data is.

###AWS securitu Responsibilities
- comprised of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities the run AWS serveices
- AWS is responsible for the security configuration of its products that are considered managed services
    - handle basic security tasks like guest operating system (OS) and database patching, firewall configuration, and disaster revocery
    - all you have to do is configure logical access controls for the resources and protect your account credentials

###Customer Security Responsibilitieswo
- AWS products tat fall into the well-understood category of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) -- such as EC2, VPC, and S3 -- are completely under your control and require you to perform all of the necessary security configuration and management tasks.
- AWS manageed services like RDS or Redshift provide all of the resouces you need in order to perform a specfic task--but without the configuration work that  can come with them. With managed services, you don't have to worry about launching and maintining instances, patching the guest OS or database, or replicating database -- AWS handles that for you
- you should protect your AWS account credentials and setup individual user accounts with Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM)
